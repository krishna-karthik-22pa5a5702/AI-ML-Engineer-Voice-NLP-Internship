**MemoTag AI/ML Task: Voice-Based Cognitive Decline Detection**

---

### 🌐 Overview
This proof-of-concept project develops a lightweight machine learning pipeline to detect early signs of cognitive stress or impairment using voice recordings. It uses a combination of natural language and audio features to model deviations that could signal cognitive decline.

---

### 🔎 Dataset
- **Samples**: 8 anonymized/simulated voice clips (~4–8 seconds each)
- **Transcriptions**: Created to simulate hesitation, pauses, and speech confusion patterns

---

### 🧬 Feature Engineering
**Extracted from audio and transcribed text:**
- **Pauses per sentence**: Detected from fillers like "um", "uh"
- **Hesitation markers**: Frequency of filler words
- **Speech rate**: Words per sentence
- **Hesitation ratio**: Fillers as a percentage of words

---

### 📊 ML Modeling Approach
**Unsupervised Techniques Used:**
1. **KMeans Clustering**: To group speakers by speech patterns
2. **Isolation Forest**: To detect anomalies indicating potential cognitive impairment

These methods were chosen for their interpretability and ability to identify outliers without labeled data.

---

### 🔬 Insights
- Samples with **higher hesitation and pause rates** showed **anomalous behavior** under both KMeans and Isolation Forest
- **Slower speech rate** with increased hesitation often correlated with higher anomaly scores

---

### 🔁 Next Steps
- Use **real-world clinical audio** to validate features
- Incorporate **acoustic features**: pitch variability, frequency jitter, MFCCs
- Train supervised models once labeled cognitive data is available
- Develop a **time-series tracker** for longitudinal monitoring
